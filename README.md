Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did theywant you to design?

Liam, the owner of DriverPass wants to create a website to train drivers.He believes that somany people are failing driving tests because there is not proper training.For this website, eachuser will have their own account with a unique username and password.The customers will beable to purchase packages that have different levels of training, that include online training, onthe road training, and online tests.Customers will also be able to create, edit, or cancel drivertraining appointments on the website.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well on the Business Requirements Document. This is a very important document to 
outline the things that the system needs, the purpose of the system, and the objectives and 
goals.
 If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 
How would you improve it?

I would revise the Gantt Chart that was part of the Business Requirements Document. There is a
lot that could be done to improve it and make it easier to read and understand. The Gantt Chart 
I created does what it needs to do, but with a few adjustments and a clearer timeline, it would 
be greatly improved.
 How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it 
so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is extremely important to consider the user’s needs when designing anything. You can make a 
great application or website, but if it is not user friendly no one will use it. Without a system 
being in use, you cannot make money from it. Personally, if I have a hard time interacting with a 
system, I will not use it. 
In most situations where I am interpreting user’s needs, I put myself as the user. I think about 
the things I would want and things that would make the application or website more accessible. 
In this project I did that, as well as implement everything that DriverPass stated in the interview.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the 
future to analyze and design a system?

The first step in designing software would be to get the requirements of the system. If it is a new
system, what is needed? 
If it is an existing system, what needs to be changed? The DriverPass 
interview was a great way to get those requirements. From those requirements, design 
documents can then be created. From all of those a working system can then be created. In the 
future, I would try to implement all these processes. I believe that together they make creating 
and designing a system much easier
